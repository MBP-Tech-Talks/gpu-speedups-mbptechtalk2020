A grid is composed of many blocks, which are composed of many threads.  Threads within the same block can communicate much more easily than threads in different blocks.  The main mechanism for this communication is *shared memory*.  Shared memory is discussed extensively in the CUDA C Programming Guide, as well as many other books on CUDA programming.  We will only describe it very briefly here, and focus mainly on the Python syntax for using it.\n","\n","Shared memory is a section of memory that is visible at the block level.  Different blocks cannot see each other's shared memory, and all the threads within a block see the same shared memory.  It does not persist after a CUDA kernel finishes executing.  Shared memory is scarce hardware resource, so should be used sparingly or side effects such as lower performance or even kernel launch failure (if you exceed the hardware limit of 48 kB per block) will occur.\n","\n","Shared memory is good for several things:\n"," * caching of lookup tables that will be randomly accessed\n"," * buffering output from threads so it can be coalesced before writing it back to device memory.\n"," * staging data for scatter/gather operations within a block\n"," \n","As an example of the power of shared memory, let's write a transpose kernel that takes a 2D array in row-major order and puts it in column-major order.
