However, not all functions can be written as ufuncs.  Many problems require greater flexibility, in which case you want to write a *CUDA kernel*, the topic of this notebook. \n","\n","Fully explaining the CUDA programming model is beyond the scope of this tutorial.  I highly recommend that everyone writing CUDA kernels with Numba take the time to read Chapters 1 and 2 of the CUDA C Programming Guide.

The CUDA compiler and driver will execute our kernel across a *thread grid* that is divided into *blocks* of threads.  Threads within the same block can exchange data very easily during the execution of a kernel, whereas threads in different blocks should generally not communicate with each other (with a few exceptions).\n","\n","Deciding the best size for the CUDA thread grid is a complex problem (and depends on both the algorithm and the specific GPU compute capability), but here are some very rough heuristics that we follow:\n","\n","  * the size of a block should be a multiple of 32 threads, with typical block sizes between 128 and 512 threads per block.\n","  * the size of the grid should ensure the full GPU is utilized where possible.  Launching a grid where the number of blocks is 2x-4x the number of \"multiprocessors\" on the GPU is a good starting place.  Something in the range of 20 - 100 blocks is usually a good starting point.\n","  * The CUDA kernel launch overhead does depend on the number of blocks, so we find it best not to launch a grid where the number of threads equals the number of input elements when the input size is very big.

The pattern of computing a starting index and a stride is a common way to ensure that your grid size is independent of the input size.  The striding will maximize bandwidth by ensuring that threads with consecuitive indices are accessing consecutive memory locations as much as possible.
